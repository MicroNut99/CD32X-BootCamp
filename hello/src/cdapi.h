/* cdapi.h - the CD32X services for a game's master SH2 (CD32X BootCamp)
 *
 * Everything the 32X cannot do itself goes to the Sega CD's Sub-CPU (stack/subcpu/main.c) as a
 * command: the master SH2 writes the arguments to COMM2 / COMM8, the command number to COMM0,
 * and waits until the Sub-CPU sets COMM0 back to 0.  Only the MASTER SH2 sends commands.
 * Full table: docs/03_COMMANDS.md.  Status codes for debugging go to COMM12 (cd_status).
